## Hi, I'm Nathan

I'm a software engineer and builder.  I make the world a better place by creating innovative products with new technology, I'm currently developing [sfact.io](https://sfact.io), a project aimed at reimagining how people play games online.

```js
const nathan = ipsum(dolor, sit);
// !callout[/amet/] This is a callout
const [amet, consectetur] = [0, 0];
lorem.adipiscing((sed, elit) => {
  if (sed) {
    amet += elit;
  }
});
```

Here is some more things about me.
