title: React Server Actions
summary: React Server Actions allow you to run functions on the server directly from your React components. Think of them as a bridge between client-side interactions and server-side logic. Instead of setting up an API endpoint for every little server interaction, you can define actions that execute server-side with a simple function call from the client.

I really like the idea of the UI being a shared responsibility between the client and server. Just as JSX blurred the lines between HTML, CSS and JavaSCript, newer React, with the help of a server-first framework like Next.js, is blurring the lines between the client and server.

## What Are Server Actions in React?

<Callout>
Update: In the new React documentation, it appears that "Server Actions" have been renamed or made into a larger group of features called Server Functions.

> Until September 2024, we referred to all Server Functions as “Server Actions”. If a Server Function is passed to an action prop or called from inside an action then it is a Server Action, but not all Server Functions are Server Actions.

Maybe this means they are adding GET based Server Queries or something. I'm going to keep calling them Server Actions for the moment.

Server Actions allow you to run functions on the server directly from your React components. Think of them as a bridge between client-side interactions and server-side logic. Instead of setting up an API endpoint for every little server interaction, you can define actions that execute server-side with a simple function call from the client.

### Practical Benefits

- **Co-Location**: Server logic lives alongside or within components, reducing context switching.

- **Simplified Flow**: For small operations, you might not need to design a full-fledged API. A 'use server' function can handle basic data mutations or queries directly.

- **Execution Context**: When a Server Action is called, whether from a form submission or a client component, the execution happens server-side. This means all server environment variables, database connections, and file system access are directly available

### How It Works

```jsx actions.ts
'use server'

export async function createPostAction(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title')
  const content = formData.get('content')

  const post = await db.posts.create({ title, content })

  return post
}
```

```jsx post-form.tsx
'use client'

import { createPostAction } from './actions'

function PostForm() {
  const createPost = async (formData: FormData) => {

    const newPost = await createPostAction(formData)

    redirect(`/posts/${newPost.id}`)
  }

  return (
    <form action={createPost}>
      <input name="title" type="text" />
      <textarea name="content"></textarea>
      <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Things to Consider

**Not a Silver Bullet**: Complex interactions like streaming will still require traditional API endpoints.

**Performance**: Be cautious about the potential for increased server load. If every small action triggers a server function, it could scale poorly.

**Security**: Ensure that Server Actions are properly authenticated and authorized. Understand that "use server" at the top of a file exposes every exported function as an endpoint.

## Conclusion

React Server Actions provide a convenient method for handling certain types of server interactions directly from React components. They're particularly useful for straightforward, secure operations that benefit from being closely tied to the component's logic.
