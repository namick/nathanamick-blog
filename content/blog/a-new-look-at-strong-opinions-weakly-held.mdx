**Strong opinions (weakly held)**, we hear this desired attribute a lot, in mantras and job descriptions from companies looking for talented engineers who will not detract from the unique and valuable culture they currently have.

Attributed to [Paul Safo](https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/), who was originally talking about individual thought, today it has been applied across the entire tech industry and used to describe a soft skill nurtured in teams. They want passion... and something else.

Great teams are built from people with passion. And we _do_ have passion, we're programmers who love the craft. This is what we would be doing even if we weren't getting paid.

But effective teams also require people who are flexible and able to be won over to a different, possibly opposing viewpoint. People who are not so attached to what they believe that they are unable to hear or accept evidence that clashes with their understanding.

Apart from the slogans and catchphrases, how is this applied in our daily work building stuff together? What does this actually look like?

## Monday at the Office

Imagine a conference room, vibrant with gadgets and half-erased whiteboard scribbles. Here, developers, armed with their MacBooks and coffee, dive into discussions for their next greenfield project. Two engineers debate, not over trivialities, but pivotal choices shaping their project's future.

### The Debate

Two engineers are passing the conversational ball back and forth. Their passion fuels the discussion, making their viewpoints not just heard but felt. It's a clash of well-reasoned arguments, each riding on the wave of strong conviction

The passion of a well-articulated, and well-reasoned _(strong)_ viewpoint is contagious and can be unifying, and we see that here. It builds consensus in this herd of cats. It is fun to listen to and generates excitement and energy, bringing life to an otherwise slightly routine Monday.

But the debate is heating up...

## The Turning Point

Luckily, these engineers both have the emotional intelligence to step back from the conversation and listen, really listen to the other side of the argument.

Instead of spiraling into conflict, something remarkable happens. One engineer, feeling the tug of an invisible timer, decides to embrace the opposing view. Not out of defeat, but from a place of growth and learning.

## The Magic of Conceding

### How It's Done

This isn't about waving a white flag; it's strategic, almost artful:

- **Self-Awareness**: Both engineers recognize the emotional undercurrents. They step back, not to retreat, but to gain perspective.

- **Active Listening**: They engage genuinely with the other's points, seeking not to respond but to understand.

- **The Decision to Be Convinced**: Here lies the crux:

  - They weigh their commitment to their opinion against the project's greater good.
  - They consciously open themselves to change, asking, "What if the other way could work?"

- **Techniques for Letting Go**:
  - **Curiosity Over Conviction**: What might this new approach teach me?
  - **Highlighting Merits**: Latching onto a valid point from the opposition to pivot one's perspective.
  - **Intellectual Humility**: Choosing team success over personal victory.

## Practical Takeaways for Teams

- **Encourage Open Debates**: Cultivate an environment where voicing strong opinions is safe and encouraged, but so is changing one's mind.

- **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams or flowcharts to depict how debates can lead to consensus, making the process visually engaging.

- **Interactive Learning**: Perhaps include a small quiz or interactive element at the end of your post asking readers to reflect on their last team debate.

## Conclusion

The ability to hold strong opinions weakly is not just a skill but an art form that benefits team dynamics immensely. We need speak out about the things that we love, the things that get us excited, the things that drive us. This is life to our team.

It's the practice of not just the voicing of our opinions but the artful grace of letting them evolve.
